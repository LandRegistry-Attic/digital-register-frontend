    <h2 class="heading-large">What is the Title Summary service?</h2>
    <p>If you’re buying or selling a house or are just interested in a property the Land Registry Title Summary service is an on-line service that will enable you to see a summary of a title</p>
    <p>The summary will give you brief facts from the Register. It tells you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the owners name and address.</li>
      <li>what they paid for the property if they purchased after April 2000 (you will not get the price paid for the property if they purchased before April 2000, or no money changed hands or the owner did not buy the property outright).</li>
      <li>if there is a mortgage on the property the Lender’s name and address.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition a map extract will be provided to identify the location of the property.</p>
    <p>You will be able to view the information on screen. You’ll only be able to view it once, you’ll need to print it out or take a screen shot.</p>
    <p>The title summary you will see will be a summary of the register at the time and date of your transaction. The Land Registry system is a live system that is updated when applications submitted to Land Registry are processed so the information on a title summary is subject to change.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-medium">When not to use the Title Summary service</h3>
    <p>If more detailed information is required such as the full legal register entry; details of access rights, rights of way and restrictions; documents to prove who owns a property for example in a court case or for a visa application; the official title plan showing indicative boundaries; a copy of the deeds.</p>
    <p>To download the relevant form to obtain an official copy of the register or any documents referred to on the register, you will need to use a different service for this information accessible at:</p>
